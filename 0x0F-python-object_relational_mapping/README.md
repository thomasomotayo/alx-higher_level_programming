Python - Object-relational mapping
In this project, I learned about how object-relational mapping is used for database scripting. I became familiar with using MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy to query, create, edit, and delete tables in MySQL.

Tests 
tests: Folder of SQL and Python scripts for setting up test tables for all files. Provided by Holberton School.
Tasks 
0. Get all states

0-select_states.py: Python script that uses MySQLdb to list all states in the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.
Usage: ./0-select_states.py <mysql username> <mysql password> <database name>.
Results are ordered by ascending states.id.
1. Filter states

1-filter_states.py: Python script that uses MySQLdb to list all states with names starting with N in the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.
Usage: ./1-filter_states.py <mysql username> <mysql password> <database name>.
Results are ordered by ascending states.id.
2. Filter states by user input

2-my_filter_states.py: Python script that uses MySQLdb to display all values matching a given name in the states table of the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.
Usage: ./2-my_filter_states.py <mysql username> <mysql password> <database name> <state name searched>.
Results are ordered by ascending states.id.
Uses string formatting to construct the SQL query.
3. SQL Injection...

3-my_safe_filter_states.py: Python script that uses MySQLdb to display all values matching a given name in the states table of the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.
Usage: ./3-my_safe_filter_states.py <mysql username> <mysql password> <database name> <state name searched>.
Results are ordered by ascending states.id.
Safe from SQL injections.
